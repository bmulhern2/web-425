    <div fxFlex>Into the Wild is a book about a young man who sets off on adventure. The man's name is Christopher McCandles but his travler name is Alexander SuperTramp. Over the course of the book Alex goes on several adventures and not to ruin the ended but he dies. The reason for such a sad ending is Alex decides to go to Alaska and live in to the woods. He eats a berry and ends up becoming sick. I thought this was a good story; considering it is true. However it is a sad story as he dies at the end.</div>
